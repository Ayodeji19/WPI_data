## World Port Index_project

### Project Overview
#### The project involves construction of an EL pipeline (extract and load), the data is being extracted from an archaic Access database (WPI.mdb) using python scripts and loaded to a standard query language(SQL) database. The data consist of port index number, port names, latitude and longitude location of several ports etc. A port name "Jurong Island" was used to determine the location of other ports nearest to the reference port name this was acheived by using the latitude and longitude values to estimate port_distances. Also, top five countries having the highest number of ports were extracted and loaded to new database.  
### Project Objective : 
#### The aim of the project is to construct an Extract Load (EL) pipeline in Python to transition the World Port Index data from the Access database and the resulted data loaded to PostgreSQL.
